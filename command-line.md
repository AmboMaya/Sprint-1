 
 Without using jargon, how would you describe the command line to a lay person (e.g. your mum)?
    The command line is a short key that you type in to navigate around inside your computer using the terminal instead of using the mouse where you simply point the icons on your screen and click use any application, open/creating documents.

 List 10 terminal commands and in plain english (i.e. with minimal technical jargon) describe what they do.

 mkdir = create a folder which is also refer to a directory.
 touch [file] = create a file
 mv -v = move or rename file from one directory to another
 rm [-r] / rm [file] = remove directory/file
 ls = list of files
 pwd = too show a full path of the current directory
 cd ~ = take you back to the root folder
 cat [file] = to output the content of a text file on the terminal
 q = exit
 clear = to clear what's on the terminal screen. This will only move everything on the screen to the top of the page.
